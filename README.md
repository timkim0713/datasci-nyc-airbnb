## Introduction

This project is to demonstrate the understanding of what the data in the NYC Airbnb Dataset show and may imply. 


The most positive correlation excluding one to itself is

reviews_per_month to number_of_reviews, which is expected because the most reviews you have, the more likely you will have reviews per month.
The most negative correlation is number_of_reviews to minimum_nights. This shows that having a higher value of minimum_nights often lead to a lower reviews.
